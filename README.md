## Virtual Fitting Machine
#### by Beidi Han


### Overview
Virtual Fitting Machine is a speculative technology. The goal is to use new technology to help consumers save time for trying on clothes, and to directly perform virtual fittings through the use of scanneing. As a player, you will make choices for the characters in the game that are of interest to the machine, and these choices will have varying degrees of consequences.
